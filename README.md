This script calculates absorption by phytoplankton and non-algal particles when using an integarating spfere in a spectrophotometer.     
The script was first written in matlab by Are Folkestad (NIVA) and used in ESA VAMP, EU REVAMP, edited by Ciren Nima during two NRC projects "Simultaneous Retrieval of Aerosol 
  and Water Quality Parameters from Ocean Colour Data in High-Latitude Coastal Waters" and #Satellite Remote Sensing of Atmosphere-Surface Systems and Ground Truth 
  Measurements", and edited by Marit Norli for use in EUFP7 HIGHROC, and now translated to python by Marit Norli.
